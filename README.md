# qr-code-component

![qr-code-component design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dirkvankrieken/qr-code-component/main/mobile-design.jpg)

For this challenge I was provided with a QR-code component design.

I transformed the design to code, using HTML and CSS.

For development I used Vite (a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience [vitejs.dev](https://vitejs.dev/)).
